DESCRIPTION

This is a simple, dual-purpose project.
1. Eliminates Problem Names from Leetcode Links... Just enter the Problem #, and you're automatically rerouted to the specific problem. Makes your navigation much more effective and simple.
2. Allows you to query profile/submissions data by username. (Ongoing)

More unique features to be added in the future...
